# 🧠 AI-Based Disease Prediction and Chatbot System

A **web-based healthcare assistant** that intelligently predicts diseases based on user-reported symptoms and responds to health-related queries using a chatbot. This project combines **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **LLM (Large Language Model)** to enhance digital healthcare accessibility and user experience.


## 📌 Project Overview

With the rise in demand for instant medical assistance, this system is designed to help users:
- Get **preliminary disease predictions** based on their symptoms
- Ask **health-related questions** and receive real-time responses via a chatbot
- Access **medical insights** in a user-friendly and conversational way

This application does **not replace professional medical advice** but serves as a first-level assistant for awareness and education.


## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Disease Prediction** using ML algorithms (KNN, Decision Tree)
- 🤖 **Chatbot Integration** powered by LLM for answering health-related queries
- 🌐 **Web Interface** developed using Flask and HTML/CSS
- 📊 **Symptom Analysis** using semantic and syntactic similarity
- 🧠 **Custom Ontology** for accurate symptom-disease mapping

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Flask  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK / spaCy  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- LLM (Large Language Model) Integration
